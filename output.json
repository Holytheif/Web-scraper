He has facial hair that extends from the ends of his mouth to his chin, and his nose comprises of a narrow bridge, sloping outward, like the forehead, and ending in a large, wide, and rounded set of nostrils. His legs are thin and hairy. He is almost always smiling or laughing even after being wounded. He also has an X-shaped scar on his stomach and another scar on his left shoulder. His Flintlock is always in his hand or tucked in his pants.Black's personality is quite similar to that of the World Nobles, albeit somewhat less extreme, believing that impressive heritage and high status will grant him immunity and undeserved rights. The difference is that the World Nobles, and other Royalty, are mostly correct, unfortunately, and do receive such privileges, while Black's ruse is only impressive to other criminals. He is extremely ruthless and egotistical, using the real Luffy's reputation to act with impunity. With Luffy's exceedingly high bounty and known infamy, Black believes he can get away with virtually anything. He treats his reputation as an entitlement, expecting others to accommodate him simply because he is a famous pirate. He seems to have enough common sense to realize that his reputation alone will not protect him from everyone, though he still attempts to use it as leverage in a pinch. Black angers easily when things do not go as planned, or at any perceived slight by anyone he meets. He treats something as simple as being knocked down as an offense to kill someone over. This seems to extend from his stolen reputation, as he believes the act gives him the right to behave as such. Because of his ego, Black, in attempting to exact revenge, seems to be blinded to the dangers his opponents represent. Despite the real Nami, Usopp, and Luffy all dispatching him and his immediate crew with casual ease, his anger drives him to get revenge at any cost, even gathering his entire collection of recruits just to deal with three people. He also attempted to talk down Sentomaru using his reputation, even though Sentomaru clearly did not buy his act."

He sported an impressive mustache, and, unlike his amoral brethren, possessed remarkably kind facial features and a rather thin face. He wore the typical garb of a World Noble during his tenure at Mary Geoise: a thick white suit with medal-like knobs on it, and a blue collar.Unlike the typical World Nobles, Homing did not show any sign of arrogance or cruelty and viewed himself as a human being, like all normal people. He was humble as well as extremely kind and wished to live an ordinary life among commoners. Because of his great benevolence, he was seen as peculiar for a Celestial Dragon, and his compatriots even condemn him for being blasphemous for equaling himself with the rest of humanity; Homing took no offense in their insults and calmly brushed them off. However, after experiencing discrimination by angry victims of the World Nobles, he realized that he was naïve as he had no prior knowledge of the hatred and resentment commoners had towards World Nobles. Despite his pampered past, he was at least appreciative of even the most minor opportunities for his family's safety, as when they found a relatively safe hideout in the junkyard, he felt relieved despite the insect infestations that Doflamingo alone complained about. Homing was willing to owe up to his own mistake by pleading the Celestial Dragons to rescue just his wife and sons, showing he was prepared to be left behind to reap what he sow as long as his family remained safe."

It was often affectionally referred to as simply Merry (メリー, Merī?) by the crew.Originally designed by Kaya's servant Merry, it was gifted to the Straw Hats for defending Syrup Village against the Black Cat Pirates. Over time, it came to be loved by the crew as a home and as a friend, so much so that she eventually developed a life of her own and became a genuine crew member. Unfortunately, the Going Merry took an inordinate amount of damage during her \\lifetime\\, being blown up, impaled, sliced up multiple times, and partially eaten by Wapol. Eventually, the Merry could no longer continue and after helping the Straw Hats escape Enies Lobby, it received a Viking funeral.The Going Merry had a jib and a central steer rudder. The ship's armaments consisted of four cannons, one in the bow pointing forward, one in the stern, and two pointing to either side. They were rarely used, as the Straw Hat Pirates usually preferred to run away or engage in hand to hand combat. After the Arlong Park Arc, the Going Merry gained three tangerine trees from Bell-mère's orchard, a memento of Nami's home. As the crew traveled through the first half of the Grand Line, the ship received more and more damage and gained several metal patches to hold her together at places that could not be nailed back together: prominent examples are Merry's figurehead and the mast, which was torn off several times. Several spots of the guardrail were damaged and missing, leading the crew to patch them up with wood-boards, which was done rather crudely due to their lack of experience in carpentry. By the time it reached Water 7, the keel was damaged, which was considered to be irreparable in the long run, thus dooming Merry. In the Skypiea arc, the body of the ship had wings and the sheep figurehead was dressed as a chicken."

His birth was toasted for during the Winter Solstice Festival. He had the privilege to propose to the 23rd daughter of Charlotte Linlin, a person most hated by the entire race of giants. His subjects certainly seemed to support him full-heartedly when he confessed his love to Lola. Had the marriage been successful, the giants' hatred for Linlin would have ceased, showing their respect for Loki is stronger than their universal hatred for Linlin. Consequently, when Lola escaped and Linlin attempted to pass off her twin Chiffon as a replacement, the giants discovered the deception and came to detest Linlin further for offending their prince.As a giant, Loki is considerably more powerful than the average person. As prince of Elbaf, he commands an entire military of giants, which is said to be the strongest in the entire world; Big Mom was confident that, had she taken over that military, she could have defeated the other Four Emperors and become the Pirate King. Being the prince, he also had the privilege of proposing to the 23rd daughter of Big Mom, who was deeply hated by the giants, and had the marriage been successful, Loki's political influence would have allowed the giants' grudge against Big Mom to cease.

Being separated from people it cares for will make the snake just as sad and upset as not hearing the bell, and Nola will not forget the people it loses even after centuries have passed."

On Each upper arm was a red brassard with, again, said insignia, which was further borne as a buckle by the light-brown belt present for the coat. Additionally, Shiryu wore brown, color-matching gloves and boots, below elbow and knee length respectively, and dark-green pants tucked into the latter. Further part of his uniform, draped on his shoulders like a cape, was a white overcoat with the kanji goku (獄, goku?) for \\prison\\ emblazoned on the back. It had fringeless epaulettes consisting of red, gold-bordered rectangles marked by golden Xes next to single gold buttons. The coat's sleeves were plain, lacking turned-out cuffs. In a flashback, Shiryu was seen having (as seems a trademark for high-ranking Impel Down staff) a pair of black, bat-like wing attachments on his upper back, which were no longer present by the time of his prison release."

It was kept in the Punk Hazard Burning Lands before being released.Smiley, as its other name \\Slime\\ suggests, was an enormous gelatinous red-violet mass that was compared to a mountain in size. Thanks to its Devil Fruit power it took on the shape of an axolotl with eyes, a mouth, legs, caudal fin and external gills. Smiley was able to subdivide into smaller slimes, however, the smaller slimes did not take on the shape of axolotls.Smiley would constantly emit some kind of smoke or vapor, which would poison people that inhaled or touched it. It was also very corrosive, causing great pain on its own. Despite its composition, it appeared to move rather fast, as some of Caesar's men could not escape from it, despite them being centaurs. Due to its large size, it is very hard to avoid or escape from it. Smiley also appeared to be immune to extreme heat, as it could freely move over the scorching ground in the Burning Lands without any trouble. It could also shoot pieces of itself called Smilies (スマイリーズ, Sumairīzu?) in order to cross a lake or other body of water, as it was weak to water. Even though it was immune to extreme heat, setting its body directly on fire would cause it to explode violently.

		"characterName": "Zeus",
		"characterDetails": "Zeus the Thundercloud is a homie that Big Mom formerly summoned from her left hand. He is a special kind of homie, as he received a soul fragment from Big Mom herself, and once served as one of her personal weapons alongside Prometheus and Napoleon.During the escape from Totto Land, Zeus was captured by the Straw Hat Pirates and forced to become Nami's servant. He lived inside her Sorcery Clima-Tact until he was reclaimed by Big Mom in Wano Country. However, Big Mom later abandoned Zeus for good after he struggled during the fighting on Onigashima, replacing him with another homie named Hera after she removed her soul fragment from him. Zeus then went back to Nami's ownership for good, with his soul currently inhabiting her Sorcery Clima-Tact after his old body was destroyed.After being sliced in half by Brook and then drained of electricity by Nami, Zeus's size was greatly reduced, enough to be held in one hand, and his face was enough to cover much of his body. During the raid on Onigashima, Zeus wore a blue kabuto helmet when he appeared alongside the other Straw Hats."

		"characterName": "Zunesha",
		"characterDetails": "Zunesha is a Naitamie-Norida elephant that was affiliated with Joy Boy 800 years ago. It now wanders through the New World and carries the island of Zou on its back as punishment for an unspecified crime it committed in the past.Zunesha is a gargantuan elephant, comparable to an island in sheer scale; its two-jointed legs are disproportionately and extremely long, such that it can walk on the sea floor while its upper body, including about a third of each leg, remains above the water. However, Zunesha has comparatively small eyes (shown to have turquoise, ringed irises in the anime) sunken deep into their sockets, being barely visible at most times and giving the impression that it has no eyes at all. Its gray skin is heavily wrinkled, reflecting its old age, and its ears are tattered and frayed at the edges.As part of the sentence for whatever crime it committed in the past, Zunesha is not allowed to do anything but wander around, requiring permission from someone that can understand it to act against threats to its well-being. Miyagi speculates that Zunesha is not walking aimlessly and may, in fact, be looking for a certain location."
